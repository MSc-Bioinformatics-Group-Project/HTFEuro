        SNPEuro is a simple user-friendly platform where single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information for a genomic region 
        of interest from a single chromosome is available from different populations in Europe. These include British, CEPH, 
        Finnish, Iberian and Toscani. Search features of SNPEuro are linked to a curated database with information on the SNPs. 
        You are able to receive an output for genotype and allele frequencies relative to selected SNPs. You can also visualise 
        calculated statistics relative to the chosen SNP, which include a measure of genetic/nucleotide diversity, haplotype 
        diversity and neutrality. When multiple populations are selected, population genetic variation for each pair value is 
        reported. You can visualise the data with the graphical outputs, which can be downloaded for future use and interpretation.
